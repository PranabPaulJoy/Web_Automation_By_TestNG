# Web_Automation_By_TestNG

## What are Selenium and JUnit:

**Selenium** is a free (open source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python, etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as **Selenium Testing**.

Selenium automates web browsers. It is most famous for enabling rapid, repeatable web app testing, which allows developers to ship new releases faster and with confidence.

Most programmers and developers who build website applications and wish to test them every now and then use Selenium. One of the biggest advantages of Selenium, which has made it so popular, is its flexibility. Any individual who creates web programs can use Selenium to test the code and applications. Further, professionals can debug and perform visual regression tests as per the requirements of the website or code.

In most organizations, it is the job of quality analyst (QA) engineers to test web applications by using Selenium. They are required to write scripts that can help in maximizing accuracy and test coverage to make changes in the project and maintain the infrastructure of the test.

**TestNG** is one of the most widely used open source testing framework used in automation testing suite.
- TestNG is a very important framework when you are actually developing the framework from scratch level.
- TestNG provides you full control over the test cases and the execution of the test cases. Due to this reason, TestNG is also known as a testing framework.
- Cedric Beust is the developer of a TestNG framework.
- If you want to run a test case A before that as a pre-request you need to run multiple test cases before you begin a test case A. You can set and map with the help of TestNG so that pre-request test cases run first and then only it will trigger a test case A. In such way, you can control the test cases.
- TestNG framework came after Junit, and TestNG framework adds more powerful functionality and easier to use.
- It is an open source automated TestNG framework. In TestNG, **NG** stands for **"Next Generation"**.
- TestNG framework eliminates the limitations of the older framework by providing more powerful and flexible test cases with help of easy annotations, grouping, sequencing and parametrizing.
